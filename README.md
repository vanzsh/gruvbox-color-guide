# Gruvbox Color Guide

A complete Gruvbox Theme color palette reference in tabular form — including hex codes, 256-color values, and stylistic roles for both **dark** and **light** modes. Designed for designers, developers, and themers who want an accessible, structured reference to Gruvbox’s color system.

## 🌱 Inspiration

This reference was created due to the lack of publicly available, well-structured Gruvbox color tables. While the original Gruvbox repository by **morhetz** inspired this work, the tables were newly created and structured from scratch.

Creator of Gruvbox's GitHub: [Pavel Pertsev](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox)

## ✍️ Author’s Note

I built this for myself and anyone else who needs quick and structured access to the full Gruvbox color palette. The motivation came from noticing how scattered or outdated most online resources are. Feedback, improvements, and suggestions are welcome!
